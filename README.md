Boo: A Simple counter - React.js Counter -  Task for Bild.

Boo's Features:
1. User can increment and decrement counter by 1 by using + and - buttons.
2. User can input a value in the input field (of type number) and click "Add amount" to directly add that to the existing counter value.
3. Only when the current value is an odd number, the "Add if odd" button click adds the entered input value to the current counter value.

How to use:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies via "yarn install" or "npm install"
3. run yarn run dev to meet Boo.
4. Don't worry! Boo is type safe.

Notes:
1. I downgraded next version from latest to 13.3 as it's the highest version supported by Node 16.8.
2. Node 16.8 is the highest version the borrowed laptop of my friend (MacOS high seirra 10.13) supports. I apologise for this unasked downgrade.
3. I took liberty in adding some CSS, to name the counter as Boo. I loved the logo and the favicon, It's too cute to ignore.
4. I added some functionality to Verify page.
5. When you run Boo on localhost, go to verify page when counter is an odd number and when it's even.
